# Introduction

The current document was written with the aim of provide a brief (or not) explanation
of different shortcuts that controls my personal computer.

I'm a vim lover. Thus, I usually try to apply vim emulation to everything.
That means, that normally I install and use tools that are 'vim friendly'. Therefore, if you're familiar
with basic vim shortcuts, you'll be fine using this configuration. Otherwise,
you'll have more difficulties.

Anyway, you can always check vim shortcuts in the Vim section below.
